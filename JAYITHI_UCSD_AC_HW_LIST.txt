HOME WORK 1


TOPIC 1
90 PROBLEMS TO GET STARTED
So glad we got the first class out of the way.
Wonderful work Everyone. 
Please upload .IPYNB here. I would prefer all the cells to already be run when you save it. 
Please as instructed in class include all relevant coding notes and sources. 
Please also include how long it took you to complete all the problems you could complete.
You do not have to complete all the problems.

 
TOPIC 2
INTRO TO PYTHON 1 SET
Intro to Python Problems If you finish the other problems and don't have enough work

FLOWERS MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
We are doing Machine Learning today
(Tentative) Please submit completed python workbooks if we don't complete them in class.
(Required) Please submit completed Flowers Machine Learning Project


TOPIC 3
Work from Intro Topics. Please Complete the Following

MORE INTRO PROBLEMS
GEOMETRIC ART(https://github.com/tolgaatam/ColabTurtle)
CHATBOT
BIOINFORMATICS
MAKING A HEART WITH PYTHON




HOME WORK 2


TOPIC 1
ONLINE TUTORIALS(I chose three)
Several of you asked for other examples in machine learning that we would have no way of covering in this short amount of time. If you look online there are plenty of examples of deep learning, neural networks, natural language processing etc. I have provided some here. Please complete 1 or 2 the examples with code and markdown/text that explain what you were able to learn from these. Especially if these examples are different than the ones we did in class. I would key in on the Keras Code examples or Credit Card Fraud detections those looked fun.

(The one tab link)

KERAS TUTORIAL: THE ULTIMATE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO DEEP LEARNING IN PYTHON
INTRO AND APPROACHING A MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEM
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING IN PYTHON


TOPIC 2
LOAN ASSIGNMENT:
Fill in Code:  I have removed a lot of the code from them that makes them work. You are to fill in the code to complete the IPYNB and this complete the study. Identify any new commands that you needed to implement, and what you learned from the overall exercise. I uploaded a baddataset and a gooddataset.
Loan Repayment (I really think this will help with your understanding of Machine Learning and what how they compare models to determine what to do)


WINE PROJECT:
Please Also Complete tutorial on predicting wine quality. Focus on adding notes for new syntax or modules. Complete the requested add ons from lecture
https://www.kaggle.com/code/kdsharma/predicting-wine-quality-88-accuracy/log
I have uploaded dataset.






HOME WORK 3
TOPIC 1 
DATA SCIENCE PROJECT 
I'm giving you until after your Final Project is due to complete this. 
Go to this github link: It has tons of projects in data science: https://github.com/veb-101/Data-Science-Projects

1. Complete 1 Intermediate Example on this page
2. Complete 1 Advanced Example on this page

Earn points by completing the example, exposing any errors in the code, attempting to solve any errors in the code, and notetaking on new libraries and functionalities learned by completing these examples You need to turn in two different .ipynbs for this.

I CHOSE:
INTERMEDIATE LEVEL CHATBOT
ADVANCED LEVEL BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION

TOPIC 5 
Bonus Assignment due to Class Interest

Pick two of the below and complete. Point out/Correct errors in code. Point out things that you learn or find interesting. See if other code you've used for class can improve the code. Add a markdown at the end that explains your work. If you look up the document names you should be able to find the links associated.
